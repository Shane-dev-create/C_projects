## Description

A simple calculator program which I will continue to work on and perhaps even try creating a scientific calculator if all goes well. The program takes user input and performs the desired arithmetic operations on the entered numbers. Just for fun I've added silly messages and greetings.

## How To Use

-Program starts off by prompting the user for their name and uses the user's name in a greeting.  
-The user is then presenting with a choice of arithmetical operations to perfom. So far functionality is very basic, we just have Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*) and Division (/) available (More to come in future).  
-The user makes their choice and then gets prompted to enter the operands of the calculations. The results of the calculations are printed out and the user is prompted to either continue doing calculations or exit the program.

### Installation

#### Download the source code and compile  
make calc_v1 (in Visual Studio Code) or:  
gcc --std=c17 -Wall -pedantic -o calc_v1 calc_c.c (in Mac or Linux terminal)
